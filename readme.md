# KB's Project Manager

A full-stack web application for organizing work into projects and tasks. Each project contains a list of tasks tracked as either pending or complete. The interface is split into two panels — select a project on the left to view and manage its tasks on the right.

Built with Flask on the backend and React on the frontend, communicating over a REST API.

## Features

- Create, edit, and delete projects with a title and description
- Create, edit, and delete tasks within a project
- Tasks are categorized as pending or complete
- Toggle task status with a checkbox
- Confirmation dialog before any deletion
- Timestamps displayed on projects and tasks for when each was created and updated
- Floating modal forms — no page navigation required
- Tasks are automatically linked to the currently selected project
- Branded header with logo mark and navigation

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 18 (Vite) |
| Backend | Python 3.12, Flask |
| Database | SQLite via Flask-SQLAlchemy |
| API | RESTful JSON over HTTP |
| Cross-origin | Flask-CORS |

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.12+** — [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Node.js 18+ and npm** — [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- **WSL** (Windows users only) — required to run the backend on Windows

To verify your versions:

```bash
python3 --version
node --version
npm --version
```

---

## Getting Started

The app has two parts that run simultaneously — a Flask backend and a React frontend. You will need **two terminal windows** open at the same time.

> **Windows (WSL) users:** Always activate the virtual environment before running any Python commands. Your prompt should show `(venv)` at the start. If it does not, run `source venv/bin/activate` first.

### Step 1 — Navigate to the project

```bash
cd summative_2
```

### Step 2 — Set up the backend

In your **first terminal**:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate it — you must do this every time you open a new terminal
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up and seed the database with sample data
python seed.py

# Start the Flask server
python app.py
```

Flask will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### Step 3 — Set up the frontend

In a **second terminal** (no venv needed here):

```bash
cd summative_2/task-manager

# Install Node dependencies
npm install

# Start the React development server
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

> **Important:** Keep both terminal sessions running. Closing either one will take down that part of the app.

### Step 4 — Open the app

Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` in your browser. If you used the seed file, you should see two seeded projects with tasks already loaded. Select a project on the left to view its tasks on the right, or add your own!

## Data Models

### Project

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| id | Integer | — | Primary key, auto-incremented |
| title | String | Yes | Max 200 characters |
| description | Text | No | Freeform |
| created_at | DateTime | — | Set automatically on creation |
| updated_at | DateTime | — | Updated automatically on save |

### Task

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| id | Integer | — | Primary key, auto-incremented |
| project_id | Integer | — | Foreign key → projects.id |
| title | String | Yes | Max 200 characters |
| description | Text | No | Freeform |
| status | Enum | — | `pending` (default) or `complete` |
| created_at | DateTime | — | Set automatically on creation |
| updated_at | DateTime | — | Updated automatically on save |

Projects and tasks have a one-to-many relationship. Deleting a project permanently deletes all of its tasks.
